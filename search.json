    "text": "Hi, Im Murugash Manavalan and Im a PhD Scholar in Charles University, CZ.\nMy research focus revolves around the Floral Economic Spectrum (FES) and its significance in relation to the Whole Plant Economic Spectrum. In accordance with that, I am studying the interspecific variation of various plant functional traits of species belonging to the Grasslands of Czechia, giving particular emphasis to floral traits. In addition, I will also be studying how the interacting effects of different environmental factors such as nutrient availability and water scarcity alter floral traits which will provide key insights into the various adaptation strategies undertaken by plants in times of stress."
