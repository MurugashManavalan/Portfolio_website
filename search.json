In accordance with that, I am studying the interspecific variation of various plant functional traits of species belonging to the Grasslands of Czechia, giving particular emphasis to floral traits. In addition, I will also be studying how the interacting effects of different environmental factors such as nutrient availability and water scarcity alter floral traits which will provide key insights into the various adaptation strategies undertaken by plants in times of stress."

We further tried to invesitgate how these responses compare and contrast with those of leaf economic traits.\nThis entire study was conducted within the framework of the ClimGrass Experiment, a long-term climate manipulation experiment located in the Agricultural Research and Education Centre, Austria who is a also a key collaborator in this project.\nThe research article pertaining to this project is currently under review.

We aim to understand how floral traits respond to varying levels of nutrient and water availability—and their interaction—to gain deeper insights into plant resource allocation strategies.\nOur experimental system includes approximately 30 insect-pollinated species typical of Czech grasslands. Unlike our parallel project, this study expands beyond floral economic traits to also examine floral rewards and volatile compounds. Additionally, we’re investigating how reproductive traits—such as floral morphology and seed characteristics—correlate with leaf and root traits.\nInterested in this research and see potential for collaboration? Please feel free to reach out to me and we can discuss the possibility of working together."
