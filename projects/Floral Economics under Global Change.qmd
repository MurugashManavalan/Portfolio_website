In this study, we tried to examine the impacts of key global change factors-elevated temperature, increased atmospheric CO2, and drought - on the floral economic traits of two grassland species. We further tried to invesitgate how these responses compare and contrast with those of leaf economic traits. 

This entire study was conducted within the framework of the ClimGrass Experiment, a long-term climate manipulation experiment located in the Agricultural Research and Education Centre, Austria who is a also a key collaborator in this project.

The research article pertaining to this project is currently under review. You can access the preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.15.654190v1).
