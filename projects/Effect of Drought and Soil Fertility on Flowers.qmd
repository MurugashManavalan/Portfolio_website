title: "Effect of Drought and Soil Fertility on Flowers"

This project forms the foundation of my PhD research. We aim to understand how floral traits respond to varying levels of nutrient and water availability—and their interaction—to gain deeper insights into plant resource allocation strategies.

Our experimental system includes approximately 30 insect-pollinated species typical of Czech grasslands. Unlike our parallel project, this study expands beyond floral economic traits to also examine floral rewards and volatile compounds. Additionally, we’re investigating how reproductive traits—such as floral morphology and seed characteristics—correlate with leaf and root traits.

Interested in this research and see potential for collaboration? Please feel free to reach out to me and we can discuss the possibility of working together.
